Project #2: 

#User Stories#
-With this app the usser should be able to view all sneakers in their collection, edit/update a specific sneaker, delete sneakers, and create a new sneaker. The user will also be able to link a specific sneaker to a website, which will allow them to purchase the sneaker, or access details of the sneaker.

unsolved problems*
-Wanted to add users, I attemted it couldn't get it to work; basically broke all my code so I took it out, and went with a more simple page, that works.
would like to come back in the future to add users, maybe a sell feature, and potentially add more products.
